Class Roulette
==============

Get a random lecture.

How it works
------------

There are thousands of lectures on YouTube. [Here's Yale](http://www.youtube.com/user/YaleCourses). Let's pull those in and serve a random one everytime you load. Use it as background noise or to go to sleep at night.

Pull in an RSS feed of videos. Store the oEmbed data for each video URL in a Redis set.
